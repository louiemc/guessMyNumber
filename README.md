# guessMyNumber

# The goal of this project is to guess a secret number, which is between 1 and 20.

## in the input, we can type a number, click check.

## then we'll get a message, either 'too low' or 'too high.'

## we'll also see our score, which started at 20, but after a failed guess the score will decrease by 1.

## when the number is correct the screen will turn green, we'll get a correct number message, and the highscore will be the remaning score number (this highscore will be kept thoughout the game).
